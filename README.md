# Railey's Personal Portfolio Website

A project to showcase my expertise in Web Development through building a Personal Website.

**Now using ReactJS!**

Website is up at https://raileyvictuelles.herokuapp.com/

## How to use

*Note: Make sure you have a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. To check, run `node -v` in your terminal*

1. First clone this git repository to your local device
```
git clone https://github.com/Pilner/PersonalSite
```
2. Download all the dependencies and packages needed in this repository
```
npm install
```
3. Run the program
```
npm start
```

## Routes

* `/` is home page
* ~~Anything else is an error page~~

Since this is the revamped version, I opted to try and use the single page format instead of the multi-page site format.

## To-Do List

- [x] Replace Lorem Ipsum with real text
- [x] Showcase Personal Projects
- [ ] Transfer all the Features from the Old Stack
- [ ] Re-Implement the Error Page

- [ ] Add more stuff
